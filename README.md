## Features

- ‚ú® **User-Friendly**: Aurora is designed to be simple and straightforward, making it a breeze to set up and use. Just move its files to your web server's root folder to get started!

- üóúÔ∏è **Lightweight**: The Aurora codebase is incredibly compact, totaling less than 8k lines of code (loc), making it easy to grasp and work with. It doesn't rely on any external dependencies apart from the default WYSIWYG editor.

- üì¶ **Modular**: Aurora's modular design allows you to customize not only the default database management system (DBMS) but also elements like the WYSIWYG editor in the admin panel.

## Requirements

- [PHP 8.0](https://www.php.net) or higher

- [Apache 2.4](https://httpd.apache.org) or higher

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) (only for installation)

## Install

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is required to install Aurora, once you got it...

Go to your web server's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
composer create-project usbac/aurora
```

Done! You can now access your Aurora panel by going to `/admin` in your localhost (e.g., http://localhost/admin).
