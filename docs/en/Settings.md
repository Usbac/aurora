### HTML editor

By default the [TinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud) editor is used, but you can use any other editor that can be loaded via js.

This is an example using the default editor.

```js
<script src="/public/assets/js/tinymce/tinymce.min.js"></script>
<script>
    let selector = 'textarea#html';
    tinymce.init({
        selector: selector,
        plugins: [ 'image', 'wordcount', 'autoresize', 'code', 'link', 'lists' ],
        images_upload_url: '/admin/posts/upload_image',
        setup: editor => editor.on('Change Keyup', () => get(selector).innerHTML = editor.getContent()),
    });
</script>
```
