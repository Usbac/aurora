Any contribution will be highly appreciated. This can be done by submitting a issue or pull request to the Aurora repository.

Contributing for the first time to an open source project can make you feel a bit insecure, but don't worry, any misunderstanding or mistake will be understood.

## Code of conduct

Before contributing to the project, please read the following points and be sure to follow them:

* Avoid being harsh and using bad language.
* Don't be discriminatory.

Any behavior that can be qualified as harassment won't be tolerated.

## Making a contribution

### Pull request

* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Create a feature branch based on the master branch (or in the respective version branch that you will update).
* Make your changes and be sure that your commit messages are easy to understand.
* Update the version tag, tests, documentation and such if it's necessary.

### Issue

* First, make sure that the same issue does not exist before making a new one.
* Take advantage of the available labels, and use them correctly.
* For writing a issue based on a bug/error, it's recommended to answer the following questions in the issue description: 
    * What are the steps to reproduce? 
    * What is the expected behaviour? 
    * What is the environment? (Web browser, PHP version, Apache version, OS...) 
    * Do you have any additional information?
